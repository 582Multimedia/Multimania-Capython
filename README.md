- gather evidence to support your self evaluation
- meet with a mentor or teacher to:
  - confirm your level
  - discover & plan how you can improve your level
- work on your project, implementing your SMART plan
- self evaluate your progress every week
- meet briefly with your mentor to go over your progress
- when you move up a level, celebrate, check out other Capyskills and continue to improve
- Ultimately the plan is to help you improve in the areas that mean the most to you.
