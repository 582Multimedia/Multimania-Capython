## Possible Ideas

### 1. Story Jam: The Hero‚Äôs Journey in Design

- üìú Theme: Applying narrative structures (like the Hero‚Äôs Journey) to design and multimedia.
- üéØ Goal: Teams create a multimedia project (poster series, motion graphics, interactive experience, etc.) that tells a story within a set time limit.
- üõ† Constraints: Each team draws a card with a different archetype, mythic element, or unexpected plot twist to integrate into their project.
- ‚≠ê Why it works: Encourages narrative thinking in design and challenges students to connect visuals with storytelling.

---

### 2. Brand Identity Sprint: ‚ÄúFrom Zero to Brand‚Äù

- üì¶ Theme: Teams create a complete brand identity (logo, social media assets, motion piece, website mockup) for a randomly assigned fictional company or social cause.
- üéØ Goal: Develop a full branding package within a strict deadline.
- üõ† Constraints: Teams get prompts with limitations like ‚Äúa futuristic bakery‚Äù or ‚Äúa non-profit for introverts.‚Äù
- ‚≠ê Why it works: Simulates real-world branding work under time constraints and encourages collaboration between graphic, motion, and interactive designers.

---

### 3. The Multimedia Remix Challenge

- üé• Theme: Teams receive random found footage, audio clips, and images that they must remix into a cohesive multimedia project (short film, animation, motion piece, interactive experience, etc.).
- üéØ Goal: Create an experimental or narrative-driven piece using only the provided assets + simple additions.
- üõ† Constraints: Limited external resources; teams must creatively work with what‚Äôs given.
- ‚≠ê Why it works: Encourages out-of-the-box thinking, nonlinear storytelling, and fast decision-making.

---

### 4. Escape Room Challenge

- üïµÔ∏è Theme: Teams design an interactive prototype for a digital ‚Äúescape room‚Äù experience.
- üéØ Goal: The project must integrate UI elements, storytelling, and interaction design to create an engaging puzzle experience.
- üõ† Constraints: Limited to certain UI frameworks or interaction methods.
- ‚≠ê Why it works: Encourages thinking about usability, game mechanics, and narrative-driven design.

---

### 5. The ‚ÄúNo Software‚Äù Challenge

- ‚úÇÔ∏è Theme: Participants must create a multimedia project (animation, poster, interactive piece) without using any digital tools‚Äîeverything must be built physically and captured (stop motion, paper prototyping, hand-lettered typography, etc.).
- üéØ Goal: Rethink digital design by going analog first.
- üõ† Constraints: No computers‚Äîonly cameras, scanners, and traditional media allowed.
- ‚≠ê Why it works: Forces a tactile, hands-on approach to design and multimedia, fostering innovation through limitations.

---

### 6. Media Mashup Challenge

- A cross-disciplinary jam where students mix different media types to tell a compelling story.
- Theme: "Reimagining Montreal 2050," "Digital Mythologies," or "Urban Legends in AR."
- Deliverables: A short film, interactive website, animated poster, or social media campaign.
- Twist: Students must use at least three media formats (e.g., video + animation + interactive design).

---

### 7. UX/UI Challenge: Design for Good

- A weekend challenge where students redesign a digital experience for accessibility or inclusivity.
- Theme: Non-profit websites, mental health apps, or public services.
- Deliverables: Wireframes, high-fidelity prototypes (Figma), and a presentation.
- Twist: Randomly assign user personas with accessibility needs to ensure diverse perspectives.

## Capyskills Package
Capyskills Journal

In a cloud document of your choice (Figma, Teams, Canva... whatever)

- choose a skill or sub-competency like HOS.1.2 Set Goals
- self evaluate what level you are at. i.e. at level 6 you can "create an action plan for each goal".
- gather evidence to support your self evaluation
- meet with a mentor or teacher to:
  - confirm your level
  - discover & plan how you can improve your level
- work on your project, implementing your SMART plan
- self evaluate your progress every week
- meet briefly with your mentor to go over your progress
- when you move up a level, celebrate, check out other Capyskills and continue to improve
- Ultimately the plan is to help you improve in the areas that mean the most to you.
- pro tip: double-check your document is accessible to others by opening your link in an incognito window
