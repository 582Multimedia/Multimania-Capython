## Capyskills Package
Capyskills Journal

In a cloud document of your choice (Figma, Teams, Canva... whatever)

- choose a skill or sub-competency like HOS.1.2 Set Goals
- self evaluate what level you are at. i.e. at level 6 you can "create an action plan for each goal".
- gather evidence to support your self evaluation
- meet with a mentor or teacher to:
  - confirm your level
  - discover & plan how you can improve your level
- work on your project, implementing your SMART plan
- self evaluate your progress every week
- meet briefly with your mentor to go over your progress
- when you move up a level, celebrate, check out other Capyskills and continue to improve
- Ultimately the plan is to help you improve in the areas that mean the most to you.
- pro tip: double-check your document is accessible to others by opening your link in an incognito window
